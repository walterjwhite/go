goals
1. create self-contained "workspace" to capture information specific to a particular project/task
  ie. freebsd, go, java

2. integrate utilities
  text index + search - codesearch
  CLI capture         - custom library
  screenshot capture  - custom library
  ticketing           - jira
  commenting          - custom library
  run                 - custom library
    launch Java, executable with specific environment, CLI arguments, debug options, etc

  SCM / versioning    - git + custom libraries
    auto-update / rebase -
    auto-merge

  CI                  - jenkins
    build
    cancel build

  database
    run script (with secrets)

3. archive workspace
  prevents future changes to workspace, but workspace remains searchable

Problems trying to solve:
1. Where did I make X-change?
2. When did I make X-change?
3. How to save contextual information
  ie. When working on specific tickets at work,
    I create files with the ticket number so I can easily find them later and understand them better

Features:
cli
  execute command (and arguments) capture command (and arguments) and output to file, record to git, optionally take screenshots

codesearch
  index / search across all projects within workspace
  TODO: replace with bleve, codesearch requires code to be checked out, but what if you want to search across all branches or code that isn't checked out?

comment
  able to add a comment (in standard format / template) to any git working directory

jenkins
  start, stop, query build

jira
  comment, transition status

reference
  add, rename, delete, search, push ...

run
  launch java program, nodejs, etc.

task
  new, update, comment, delete ...

workspace
  new, archive
